# NBA Standings Website
An NBA Standings website made using HTML and CSS (no templates) and Express.js that gets teams' data from an NBA API.
I created this as a part of a crash course tutorial in preperation for teaching Web Development classes at AI camp. I chose not to use Bootstrap or Tailwind templates, but rather build the site from scratch.
